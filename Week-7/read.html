                it to know how it would end.</td>

            <td>4/5</td>
            <td>I recommend. It was really eye opening. Only reason it is a 4 is becuase although I found 
                the facts given to be very educational, it would really bring me out of the story in a way 
                that was difficult to get back in.

            <td>I recommend. I did enjoy this book more than I thought I would. That ending though! We 
                did not need that to happen how it did. But it also makes understanding their feelings 
                more reasonable.

            <td>I recommend!! I'm really enjoying this story! It is fun and the girl's pov whenever she 
                hears something she shouldn't have is so funny. Also the mom's personality is entertaining 
                in a different way than expected.
