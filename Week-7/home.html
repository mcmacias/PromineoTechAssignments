    <h2>How this works</h2>
    <p>You will be able to navigate through my list of To Be Read(TBR) books and my list of books read this month</p>

    <h3>To Be Read (TBR)</h3>
    <p>TBR will navigate you to my list of books that I a will hopefully read in the near future. There you will
        have the option of recommending any books you'd like to add to my (already too long) list. 
    </p>

    <h3>Read</h3>
    <p>Read will navigate you to the list of books I have read so far this month. This is modified every month and will 
        only keep the books I have finished within that month. There you will see my ratings for these books.
